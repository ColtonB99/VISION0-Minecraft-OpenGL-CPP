# VISION0---Minecraft-OpenGL-C-
Learning OpenGL and C++ both from scratch via project based learning.


So, I started this project around 2 weeks ago (as of 9/8/2022) with 0 knowledge of C++, OpenGL and everything in between.
I've learned so much in such a short period of time, I thought i'd use GitHub to keep track of my progress better.
